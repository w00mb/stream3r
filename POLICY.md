# Interaction and Prioritization Policy

This document outlines proposed guidelines for recording project discussions, iterative commentary, and user feedback, as well as a framework for prioritizing feature requests.

## 1. Recording Interactions

To ensure transparency, maintain a historical record, and facilitate knowledge sharing, all significant project interactions should be recorded.

*   **Brainstorming & Design Discussions:**
    *   **Method:** For real-time discussions (e.g., voice calls, chat), a designated note-taker should summarize key decisions, action items, and unresolved questions. These summaries should be committed to a dedicated Markdown file (e.g., `MEETING_NOTES.md` or `DISCUSSIONS.md`) within the project repository.
    *   **Benefit:** Provides a searchable history of architectural and design choices.
*   **Iterative Commentary & Feedback:**
    *   **Method:** Utilize GitHub's built-in features:
        *   **Pull Request Reviews:** For code-specific feedback and discussions.
        *   **Issue Comments:** For discussions related to specific features, bugs, or tasks.
    *   **Benefit:** Keeps discussions contextual and linked directly to the relevant code or work item.
*   **User Discussions & Feature Requests:**
    *   **Method:** All user-initiated feedback and feature requests should be captured as GitHub Issues.
    *   **Standardization:** Use a consistent labeling system (e.g., `type: feature-request`, `type: bug`, `status: new`, `status: triaged`).
    *   **Detail:** Encourage users (or internal team members capturing feedback) to provide clear descriptions, expected behavior, and steps to reproduce (for bugs).
    *   **Benefit:** Centralizes user feedback, making it trackable and actionable.

## 2. Prioritization Framework (Frequency-Based)

Prioritization of feature requests will be influenced by their frequency of mention or request, alongside strategic alignment and effort.

*   **Frequency Tracking:**
    *   **Method:** Regularly review GitHub Issues labeled `type: feature-request`.
    *   **Manual Review:** Periodically (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly) review new and existing feature requests. Identify recurring themes or identical requests.
    *   **Advanced (Future):** Explore using GitHub API to programmatically count mentions of specific keywords or labels across issues over a defined period. This could provide quantitative data on demand.
    *   **Benefit:** Ensures that features frequently requested by users receive appropriate attention.
*   **Prioritization Criteria (beyond frequency):**
    *   **Strategic Alignment:** How well does the feature align with the overall project roadmap and high-level goals?
    *   **Impact:** What is the potential positive impact on users or the business (e.g., user satisfaction, revenue, efficiency)?
    *   **Effort:** What is the estimated development effort (time, resources) required to implement the feature?
    *   **Dependencies:** Are there other features or technical prerequisites that must be completed first?
*   **Triage Process:**
    *   **Regular Sessions:** Schedule dedicated "triage" meetings (e.g., monthly) to review new feature requests, assign initial labels (type, status, priority), and discuss their alignment with the roadmap.
    *   **Decision Making:** Decisions on prioritization should involve relevant stakeholders (e.g., product owner, lead developer).

## 3. Benefits & Complexity Considerations

Implementing these policies introduces some initial overhead but offers significant long-term benefits:

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Improved Communication:** Clear channels for discussions and feedback.
    *   **Enhanced Transparency:** All team members have access to decisions and rationale.
    *   **Better Decision-Making:** Prioritization based on data (frequency) and strategic alignment.
    *   **Reduced Duplication:** Less time spent on re-discussing old topics or re-implementing features.
    *   **Stronger Accountability:** Clear action items and ownership.
    *   **Scalability:** Processes become more robust as the team and project grow.
*   **Complexity:**
    *   **Initial Setup:** Requires defining labels, setting up meeting note templates, and educating the team.
    *   **Discipline:** Requires consistent adherence from all team members to record interactions and use the defined processes.
    *   **Tooling Integration:** While GitHub provides many features, advanced automation (like frequency tracking via API) requires custom scripting.

This policy is a living document and will evolve as the project and team mature.
